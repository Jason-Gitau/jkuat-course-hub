## Status: Database Migration Complete âœ…

Your authentication system is fully implemented and the database has been updated successfully!

---

## What's Already Done:

âœ… **Code Implementation**
- All authentication components created
- Navigation with user menu
- Upload page with profile pre-filling
- Middleware for route protection
- User tracking in uploads

âœ… **Database Migration**
- Profiles table updated with: `university`, `course_id`, `year_of_study`, `avatar_url`, `bio`
- Materials table updated with: `user_id`, `uploader_year`, `uploader_course_id`
- RLS policies configured
- Helper functions created
- Indexes added for performance

âœ… **Environment Configuration**
- `.env` file configured with correct port (3001)
- Supabase URL and keys set up
- Dev server running successfully

âœ… **Google OAuth**
- Already configured in Supabase Dashboard
- Callback URL received: `https://dmtscfvythxxnhluyscw.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

---

## Remaining Setup Steps:

### Step 1: Configure Redirect URLs in Supabase Dashboard

You need to add your app's callback URLs to Supabase so it knows where to redirect users after authentication.

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Select your project**: `dmtscfvythxxnhluyscw`
3. **Navigate to**: Authentication â†’ URL Configuration
4. **Add these URLs** to "Redirect URLs":
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3001/**
   ```
5. **Save changes**

### Step 2: Test the Complete Authentication Flow

Once you've added the redirect URLs, test the entire flow:

#### Test 1: New User Sign Up
1. Open incognito window
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3001/auth/login`
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. Sign in with Google
5. **Expected**: Redirected to onboarding page
6. Fill in the form:
   - Full Name: (should be pre-filled from Google)
   - University: JKUAT
   - Course: Select a course
   - Year of Study: Select 1-5
7. Click "Complete Setup"
8. **Expected**: Redirected to your course page

#### Test 2: Profile Pre-filling on Upload
1. While still signed in, go to: `http://localhost:3001/upload`
2. **Expected**: You should see:
   - Profile banner at top with your name, course, year
   - "Your Name" field pre-filled
   - "Course" dropdown pre-selected with your course
3. Upload a test file
4. **Expected**: Upload succeeds, share message generated

#### Test 3: Sign Out and Sign In Again
1. Click your avatar in top-right
2. Click "Sign Out"
3. **Expected**: Redirected to home page
4. Click "Sign In"
5. Sign in with Google again
6. **Expected**: Redirected to home page (NOT onboarding)
7. **Expected**: Your profile info shows in navbar

#### Test 4: Verify User Tracking in Database
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check if profile was created
SELECT
  id,
  full_name,
  email,
  university,
  year_of_study,
  course_id
FROM profiles
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check if material has user tracking
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  user_id,
  uploader_year,
  uploader_course_id,
  uploaded_by
FROM materials
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Results:**
- Profile row exists with your Google email
- Material row has `user_id` matching your profile `id`
- Material has `uploader_year` and `uploader_course_id` filled

## Understanding the Authentication Flow

### How the Two Callback URLs Work Together:

```
User clicks "Sign in with Google"
        â†“
Google OAuth popup
        â†“
User authorizes
        â†“
Redirect to: https://dmtscfvythxxnhluyscw.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
        â†“ (Supabase processes the auth code)
        â†“
Redirect to: http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
        â†“ (Your code in app/auth/callback/route.js)
        â†“
Check if profile exists in database
        â†“
    [No Profile?]        [Has Profile?]
        â†“                     â†“
  /auth/onboarding           /
  (One-time setup)      (Home page)
```

### Why You Need Both URLs:

1. **Supabase's Callback** (`https://dmtscfvythxxnhluyscw.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`)
   - Add this to **Google Cloud Console** (Authorized redirect URIs)
   - Supabase uses it to receive the auth code from Google
   - Exchanges code for session token

2. **Your App's Callback** (`http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`)
   - Add this to **Supabase Dashboard** (Redirect URLs)
   - Your code handles the session
   - Checks if profile exists
   - Redirects to onboarding or home

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Redirect URL not allowed"
**Solution**: Make sure you added the URLs to Supabase Dashboard â†’ Authentication â†’ URL Configuration

### Issue: "Profile not found" after sign in
**Solution**:
1. Check if RLS policies allow profile creation
2. Try signing in again with incognito window
3. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Upload doesn't save user_id
**Solution**:
1. Verify you're signed in (check navbar shows your name)
2. Check browser console for auth errors
3. Verify cookies are being sent with requests

### Issue: Redirect loops infinitely
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Check middleware.js config matcher
3. Verify redirect URLs are correct

## Production Deployment Checklist

When you're ready to deploy to production:

### 1. Add Production URLs
In Supabase Dashboard, add your production URLs:
```
https://your-domain.com/auth/callback
https://your-domain.com/**
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables
Update your production `.env`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### 3. Update Google Cloud Console
Add production redirect URI:
```
https://dmtscfvythxxnhluyscw.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
```
(This is the same URL, but verify it's there)

### 4. Test Production Flow
- Test sign up
- Test sign in
- Test uploads with user tracking
- Verify profile persistence

## What You Can Do Now

With authentication fully set up, you can:

### User Features:
- Sign in with one click (Google OAuth)
- Automatic profile creation
- Personalized experience (see your course first)
- Pre-filled upload forms
- Track your contributions

### Analytics Queries:
```sql
-- Top uploaders
SELECT
  p.full_name,
  c.course_name,
  p.year_of_study,
  COUNT(m.id) as uploads
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN materials m ON p.id = m.user_id
LEFT JOIN courses c ON p.course_id = c.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.full_name, c.course_name, p.year_of_study
ORDER BY uploads DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Uploads by year
SELECT
  uploader_year,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM materials
WHERE uploader_year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY uploader_year
ORDER BY uploader_year;

-- Most active courses
SELECT
  c.course_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT m.user_id) as contributors,
  COUNT(m.id) as materials
FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN materials m ON c.id = m.uploader_course_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.course_name
ORDER BY contributors DESC;
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

Now that auth is working, you can add:

1. **User Profile Page** (`/profile`)
   - View and edit profile info
   - See upload history
   - View stats (total uploads, helpful votes)

2. **Leaderboards** (`/leaderboard`)
   - Top contributors by course
   - Most helpful uploaders
   - Recent activity feed

3. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`)
   - Manage users
   - Assign roles (student â†’ class_rep â†’ admin)
   - View analytics
   - Moderate content

4. **Notifications**
   - Email when someone uploads to your course
   - Weekly digest of new materials
   - Achievement notifications

5. **Role-Based Features**
   - Class reps get highlighted badge
   - Admins can approve/reject materials
   - Premium features for active contributors

- âœ… Navigation shows user info when signed in
- âœ… Upload page pre-fills name and course
- âœ… Materials are linked to user_id in database
- âœ… Protected routes require login
- âœ… Sign out works correctly
