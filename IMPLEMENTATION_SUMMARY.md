## 📈 Analytics Possibilities

With user tracking, you can now:

```sql
-- Most active uploaders
SELECT full_name, COUNT(*) as uploads
FROM profiles p
JOIN materials m ON p.id = m.user_id
GROUP BY p.id
ORDER BY uploads DESC;

-- Materials by year
SELECT uploader_year, COUNT(*) as count
FROM materials
GROUP BY uploader_year;

-- Course engagement
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(DISTINCT m.user_id) as contributors
FROM courses c
JOIN materials m ON c.id = m.uploader_course_id
GROUP BY c.course_name;
```

---

   - Weekly digest of new materials
   - Reminder to contribute

4. **Leaderboards**
   - Top contributors by course
   - Most helpful uploaders
   - Semester challenges

5. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Material download tracking
   - Popular courses
   - Peak upload times

6. **Admin Dashboard**
   - User management
   - Content moderation
   - Role assignment
   - System statistics

## 🐛 Known Considerations

### Things to Monitor:

1. **First-Time Google OAuth Setup**
   - Users need to have Google Cloud credentials
   - Redirect URLs must match exactly
   - May take 5-10 minutes for Google to propagate changes

2. **Profile Creation**
   - Make sure RLS policies allow inserts for new users
   - Verify onboarding redirects correctly
   - Check all required fields are filled

3. **Upload Performance**
   - Large files (>20MB) may take longer
   - Progress bar shows upload status
   - Network issues can interrupt uploads

4. **Session Persistence**
   - Sessions last 7 days by default
   - Auto-refresh keeps users logged in
   - Middleware handles expired sessions

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Development:
- Use incognito window to test auth flow fresh
- Check browser console for auth errors
- Use Supabase Dashboard logs for debugging
- Test on mobile devices (responsive design)

### Production:
- Set up proper email templates in Supabase
- Monitor auth logs for suspicious activity
- Set up Supabase project alerts
- Keep dependencies updated

### UX:
- Clear error messages for auth failures
- Loading states for all async operations
- Smooth transitions between pages
- Mobile-first design approach
