## 🧪 Step 1: Test Everything (DO THIS NOW)

Your dev server is running at: `http://localhost:3000`

### **Quick Test Checklist:**

1. **Test Profile Page:**
   - [ ] Go to `http://localhost:3000/profile`
   - [ ] Edit your profile information
   - [ ] Click "I'm a Class Rep" button
   - [ ] Confirm in the modal
   - [ ] Verify class rep badge appears

2. **Test Leaderboard:**
   - [ ] Go to `http://localhost:3000/leaderboard`
   - [ ] Check if your uploads show up
   - [ ] Try the filter buttons (All Time / Month / Week)
   - [ ] Verify stats are correct

3. **Test Admin Dashboard:**
   - [ ] Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/storage`
   - [ ] Check storage statistics
   - [ ] Look at Supabase usage %
   - [ ] See migration candidates count

4. **Test Upload with Compression:**
   - [ ] Go to `http://localhost:3000/upload`
   - [ ] Upload a PDF (preferably > 3MB to test compression)
   - [ ] Check console for compression logs
   - [ ] Verify file uploaded successfully

5. **Test Navigation:**
   - [ ] Click "Leaderboard" in main nav
   - [ ] Click user avatar → check "My Profile" link
   - [ ] Test on mobile (responsive)

### **What to Look For:**

✅ **Good Signs:**
- Pages load without errors
- Forms submit successfully
- Navigation works smoothly
- Console shows no red errors

❌ **Red Flags:**
- 404 errors (page not found)
- Console errors (red text)
- Forms don't save
- UI looks broken

---

## 🔧 Step 2: Set Up Cloudflare R2 (When Ready)

**When:** When your Supabase storage reaches 70% (check at `/admin/storage`)

**How Long:** 5-10 minutes

**Follow This Guide:** `CLOUDFLARE_R2_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

### **Quick Summary:**

1. **Create Cloudflare account** (free)
2. **Create R2 bucket** (name: `jkuat-materials`)
3. **Generate API token** (read & write permissions)
4. **Copy credentials** (Account ID, Access Key, Secret Key)
5. **Update `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   # Uncomment these lines (remove the # at the start)
   R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   R2_BUCKET_NAME=jkuat-materials
   ```
6. **Restart server:** `npm run dev`

### **What R2 Gives You:**
- **10GB free storage** (10x more than Supabase)
- **Zero egress fees** (free downloads)
- **Automatic overflow** (app handles everything)
- **6+ months runway** (vs 7 weeks without it)

---

## 📊 Step 3: Monitor Your Storage

### **Check Weekly:**

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/admin/storage`

**Metrics to Watch:**
- **Supabase usage %** (aim to keep < 80%)
- **Migration candidates** (files ready to move to R2)
- **Largest files** (consider migrating big ones first)

### **When to Act:**

| Usage | Action |
|-------|--------|
| < 60% | ✅ All good - keep monitoring |
| 60-70% | ⚠️ Consider setting up R2 soon |
| 70-80% | 🟡 Set up R2 this week |
| > 80% | 🚨 Set up R2 NOW + run migration |

### **Run Migration:**

```bash
# See what would be migrated (safe, no changes)
node scripts/migrate-to-r2.js --dry-run

# Migrate 20 oldest files
node scripts/migrate-to-r2.js --limit=20

# Migrate all eligible files
node scripts/migrate-to-r2.js
```

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### **Common Issues:**

**1. "Page not found" errors:**
- Check if server is running
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Restart dev server

**2. "Unauthorized" on admin pages:**
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check if your profile has `role='admin'`
- Update in database if needed

**3. Upload fails:**
- Check file size (< 50MB limit)
- Verify file type (PDF, DOCX, PPTX only)
- Look at console for error messages

**4. Compression not working:**
- Check if file is > 3MB (compression threshold)
- Look for console logs: `✅ PDF compressed`
- Verify `pdf-lib` is installed

**5. R2 errors (after setup):**
- Check all 4 env vars are set
- Make sure no `#` at start of lines
- Restart server after editing `.env`
- Verify credentials are correct
