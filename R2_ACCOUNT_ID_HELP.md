# How to Find Your Correct Cloudflare R2 Account ID

## üö® Issue: SSL Handshake Error

The error you're getting suggests the **R2_ACCOUNT_ID** in your `.env` file might be incorrect.

Current value in `.env`:
```
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=LOkjTz0XQgYIyP2BQovTn4f9P5t_Pl-Q1YusZCKW
```

This looks like an **API token** or **bucket ID**, NOT the account ID.

## ‚úÖ How to Find Your REAL Account ID

### **Method 1: From Cloudflare Dashboard URL**

1. Log into [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Go to **R2** from the left sidebar
3. Look at the URL in your browser:
   ```
   https://dash.cloudflare.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE/r2/overview
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   ```
4. Copy that **8-32 character hex string** (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8`)

---

### **Method 2: From R2 Settings**

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí R2
2. Click **"Settings"** or **"Manage R2 API Tokens"**
3. Look for **"Account ID"** displayed on the page
4. It should be a short hex string (NOT the long hash you currently have)

---

### **Method 3: From API Token Page**

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí R2 ‚Üí Manage R2 API Tokens
2. On the API tokens page, you'll see:
   ```
   Account ID: abc123def456  ‚Üê This is what you need!
   ```
3. Copy this value

## üîß What to Update

Once you find the correct account ID:

1. Open `.env` file
2. Replace the current R2_ACCOUNT_ID with the correct one:

```bash
# WRONG (current):
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=LOkjTz0XQgYIyP2BQovTn4f9P5t_Pl-Q1YusZCKW

# CORRECT (should be short hex string):
R2_ACCOUNT_ID=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
```

3. Save the file
4. Restart your dev server

|------------|------------|----------------|
| **R2_ACCOUNT_ID** | Your Cloudflare account identifier | `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8` (8-32 chars) |
| **R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID** | API token access key | `15a0660b449cc863ccbf02633e96b25b` (32 chars) |
| **R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** | API token secret | `0c2a5eae60981f8704095a5e3a1b212918d4074f3de659c29307a0ff41b6cdbf` (64 chars) |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

‚ùå **Using the bucket hash as account ID**
- The long hash in R2_PUBLIC_URL is NOT the account ID

‚ùå **Using an API token as account ID**
- API tokens are longer and have different characters

‚ùå **Using the access key as account ID**
- Access keys are for authentication, not identification

---

## ‚úÖ After Fixing

Once you update the account ID:

```bash
# Test R2 connection
node scripts/test-r2-connection.js

# You should see:
# ‚úÖ R2 credentials found in .env
# ‚úÖ Upload successful!
# ‚úÖ File verified in R2!
```

**Let me know the correct account ID and I'll update your `.env` file!**
