# Leaderboard Feature - Hidden (Not Released)

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Hidden from UI, but fully functional

---

## ✅ What I Did

### **1. Removed Leaderboard from Navigation**
- ❌ Removed "Leaderboard" link from desktop navigation
- ❌ Removed "Leaderboard" link from mobile menu
- ✅ Leaderboard page still exists at `/leaderboard`
- ✅ Can be accessed directly via URL

### **2. Fixed Import Errors**
- Fixed leaderboard page to use your existing Supabase client
- Fixed profile page to use your existing Supabase client
- Changed from `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` to `@/lib/supabase/client`

### **3. Restarted Server**
- ✅ Server running cleanly on `http://localhost:3001`
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All pages working

---

## 📍 Current State

### **Visible to Users:**
- ✅ Profile page (`/profile`) - **Active**
- ✅ Upload page (`/upload`) - **Active**
- ✅ Courses page (`/courses`) - **Active**
- ✅ Admin dashboard (`/admin/storage`) - **Active** (admin only)

### **Hidden (Still Works):**
- 🔒 Leaderboard (`/leaderboard`) - **Hidden from navigation**
  - Page exists and works
  - Just not linked in nav menu
  - Can access directly via URL
  - Ready to release when you want

## 🚀 When to Release Leaderboard

**Good reasons to release it:**
1. You have 10+ active contributors
2. You want to incentivize more uploads
3. You want social proof ("20 students contributed!")
4. You're ready for gamification

**How to release it:**

Just add the links back to `components/Navigation.jsx`:

**Desktop nav (after line 64):**
```jsx
<Link
  href="/leaderboard"
  className={`px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors ${
    isActive('/leaderboard')
      ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-700'
      : 'text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-900'
  }`}
>
  Leaderboard
</Link>
```

**Mobile nav (after line 231):**
```jsx
<Link
  href="/leaderboard"
  onClick={closeMobileMenu}
  className={`block px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-base font-medium transition-colors ${
    isActive('/leaderboard')
      ? 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-700'
      : 'text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-900'
  }`}
>
  Leaderboard
</Link>
```

## 🧪 Testing the Hidden Leaderboard

Even though it's hidden from nav, you can still test it:

1. **Direct URL access:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001/leaderboard`
   - Should load without errors
   - Shows contributors if you have uploads

2. **Verify it works:**
   - Upload a material as a logged-in user
   - Visit `/leaderboard` directly
   - Your name should appear in the list

3. **Verify it's hidden:**
   - Check main navigation - no "Leaderboard" link ✅
   - Check mobile menu - no "Leaderboard" link ✅

---

## 📊 What Still Works

**Profile Page:**
- ✅ Class rep self-declaration
- ✅ Profile editing
- ✅ Visible in nav (user dropdown → "My Profile")

**All Other Features:**
- ✅ Storage optimization (compression, R2 ready)
- ✅ Admin dashboard
- ✅ Upload flow
- ✅ Everything else unchanged

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Keep it hidden for now:**
- Launch profile + class rep system first
- Get 5-10 uploads from different students
- Then release leaderboard to show social proof
- "Look! 10 students already contributed!"

**Benefits of waiting:**
- Leaderboard won't look empty
- More impactful when you have data
- Better first impression
